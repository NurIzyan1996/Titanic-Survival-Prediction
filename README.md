## Titanic Survival Prediction
I created a prediction model (Machine Learning pipeline) to predict the survival of titanic's passengers and a web application is created using Streamlit and Heroku.I also submitted the result (new_outcome.csv in datasets folder) on Kaggle and gained public score of 0.77751.

## Files Uploaded
This repository contains 4 python files (train.py, modules.py, deploy.py, app.py).

train.py contains the codes to extract the best machine learning model with the highest accuracy and train on train.csv dataset.
deploy.py contains the codes to deploy the machine learning model on test.csv.
modules.py contains modules and functions to deploy on train.py and test .py.
app.py contains the codes to build web app (streamlit).
